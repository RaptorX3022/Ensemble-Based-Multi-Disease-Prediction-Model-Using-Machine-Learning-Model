# Ensemble-Based-Multi-Disease-Prediction-Model-Using-Machine-Learning-Model

Design and implement a machine learning framework capable of accurately detecting heart‬ ‭ disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease using various ML models.

Enhance Predictive Accuracy with Ensemble Learning. Apply ensemble techniques like Bagging,‬ Boosting, and Stacking to improve overall predictive accuracy and robustness, reducing false‬ positives and negatives.

Evaluate System Effectiveness Against Traditional Methods. Assess the performance of the‬ machine learning system by comparing its accuracy and reliability to existing diagnostic methods.‬
